# Food Ordering System (Java OOP Project)

The application features a terminal-based user interface (CLI) for interacting with users.

A Java-based object-oriented application that simulates an online food ordering system.

It includes user registration, order management, and menu categorization for both fast food and coffee shop items.

I ues some features such as Enumeration, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction and ... for this.

Of course, I made UML and usecase charts for my project.
